### ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find

* âœ… Well-structured and clean Java code for each problem
* ðŸ“‚ Categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)
* ðŸ“… Updated **daily** with new problems and solutions
* ðŸ§ª Dry runs and inline comments for better understanding

### ðŸ§  Topics Covered

* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees & Graphs
* Hashing
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Searching & Sorting
* Bit Manipulation and more...

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

* Improve coding skills and DSA knowledge
* Prepare for **coding interviews and contests**
* Build a strong foundation in core CS concepts using Java
